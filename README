ONVIF PROTOCOL FOR LINUX (TODO windows: add openssl libraries and link them in *.pro file)
For native build please use Qt creator:
	Qt/onvif_master/onvif_master.pro
	
	
For ARM cross-compile:
	1.) edit path to ARM cross compiler in env.txt (CROSS_COMPILE_PATH and CROSS_ARCH)
	2.) make target
	
	You will find builded target in build-target directory after make is done.
